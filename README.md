ORBITER2D -- My Spaceflight simulator project built in Lua

This is a simple Spaceflight simulator clone that is built in Lua Using the 'highly popular' 2d engine LOVE2D. The simulator is sometimes a bit laggy if you're in an elliptical orbit or a really high one that is, i have not optimized it yet.

DEVELOPER FEATURES :
- expandable celestial body thing for easily adding planets
